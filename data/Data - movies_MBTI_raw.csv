It would have been amazing to have one more question about the characters we pick, with several answers possible, to better understand the reasons behind our picks. For example : answer 1 -> you strongly identify with this character ; answer 2 -> you see them as a role model ; answer 3 -> you are attracted/have a crush on this fictional character ; answer 4 : you are intrigued by this character and captivated by the mystery surrounding their motivations. 

Just an idea of course. I think most people are going to pick different characters for different reasons and it would have been interesting to identify if their MBTI type has an impact on those reasons."

It doesn't even account for ambiversion (my result is usually either 51/49 or 49/51 (extraversion/introversion), which is obviously moronic and should be 50/50 instead).
D&D alignments, on the other hand, are actually surprisingly accurate, can be applied to anyone and only shift when one's personality changes significantly. One's alignment usually stays the same from birth to death."
